# RS_nodejs_FileSystem


The Node.js fs module provides functionality to interact with the file system, allowing you to manage files and directories. With this module, you can create files using the writeFile() method and directories using mkdirSync(). Reading files is simple with the readFile() method, which retrieves the content of a file. If you need to update or overwrite a file, you can use writeFile() again. Deleting files is handled by the unlink() method, and renaming files can be done with the rename() method. Additionally, the fs module can be used alongside the http module to read and serve files, such as HTML, over a server.
